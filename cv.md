#### Senior test automation engineer

###### Contact Info: t.bulavko@gmail.com

_I'm a senior test automation engineer with 10 years of experience in testing, 
almost 5 of them as a test automation engineer. Currently, in addition to a key tester role,
 I also play a role of a scrum master.
 I've been working on different projects in the past, but most of them were from e-commerce.
 My current goal is to develop myself as a mobile app developer, who perfectly knows all the stages of SDLC, since I've already have huge experience in testing._
